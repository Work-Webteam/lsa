<p><strong>THIS IS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL. NO RESPONSE IS REQUIRED.</strong><p>
<p>This email is to advise you that your employee <?php echo $first_name ?> <?php echo $last_name ?> has registered to receive a <?php echo $milestone ?> year <a href="https://longserviceawards.gww.gov.bc.ca/">Long Service Award</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>Long Service Awards registration is open to any full-time, part-time or seasonal employees who have reached a 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 year milestone with the BC Public Service by December 31, 2021. Employees who have achieved one of these milestones prior to this year but have not been recognized for it may also register.</p>
<H3>Ceremony</H3>
<p>The Long Service Award ceremonies are prestigious and memorable events held at Government House in Victoria. We are closely following the Provincial Health Officer’s directives regarding events and travel. Due to the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the award ceremonies are still to be confirmed. We will provide updates to registered recipients over the summer as well as post them to the <a href="https://longserviceawards.gww.gov.bc.ca/">Long Service Awards</a> website.  Thank you for your patience during this unprecedented time.</p>
<H3>Travel and Time Off</H3>
<p>Long Service Awards recipients from outside Greater Victoria must be approved time off to attend their ceremony. <a href="https://longserviceawards.gww.gov.bc.ca/travel/">Travel costs</a>, including transportation, hotel and meal expenses for the recipient and one guest, is covered by the employee’s organization.</p>
<p>For Victoria-based recipients, <a href="https://longserviceawards.gww.gov.bc.ca/travel/">taxi expenses</a> to and from their ceremony are covered by their organization. In addition, Victoria-based recipients must be provided a reasonable amount of time to prepare for their ceremony. It is recommended that recipients be able to leave their workplace by at least 2 pm on the day of their event without any negative impact to their pay. In cases where the recipient is a front-line worker, arrangements for coverage should be made in advance.</p>
