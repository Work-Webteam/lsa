                        Long service time is cumulative. If you've had a break in service, that time still counts twoard your years of service.

                            If you're unable to attend the ceremony in the year you register, you can defer to the following year.
                            Your award will be sent to your ministry and presented to you by your supervisor, in the year you registered.
                            Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate switching ceremony nights as each employee is scheduled to attend wit their ministry
                            and executive members. If your ministry has another ceremony date schedule, email the Long Service Award team with your request.

                    The Long Service Award ceremonies take place in the territory of the Lekwungen Peoples, also known as Songhees and Esquimalt Nations.
                    We acknowledge with respect that the public servants these ceremonies honor live and work throughout B.C. on the traditional lands of
                    Indigenous peoples. The BC Public Service is deeply committed to <u>true and lasting reconciliation</u>.
